You have met selectors already. A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. 
It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. 
The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.
